Introduction
About this document
This is the manual of feeditadvanced, the new frontend editing extension of TYPO3 4.3 and newer. 
It contains hints on installation and usage of the extension as well as notes on help with the most frequent problems. 
What's new
Since this is the first version of the manual, basically everything in here is new. This manual was written to apply to feeditadvanced 1.4.1. 
Credits
The Frontend Editing Team is mainly driven by some TYPO3 Core Developers and the Web Empowered Church. They produced most of the code. This manual was written by Christopher. 
Feedback
For general questions about the documentation get in touch by writing to documentation@typo3.org.
If you find a bug in this manual, please file an issue in the bug tracker of feeditadvanced: http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-feedit/issues

Installation
To get this extension working you need at least TYPO3 4.3. 

Install the extension in the extension manager. There are no further options to set in the extension manager; most of the extension should work out of the box. 

Go to the frontend of your website and load a page while you are logged in with a backend user. 
Now you should already see the elements, which are added by feeditadvanced: The top menu and the dashed outline around your content elements. 
You should now be able to edit all types of content elements which come with TYPO3 by default. For custom content element types (like for example tt_news records), an additional configuration is needed. You find an example in the section "Use feeditadvanced with any kind of record" later in this manual. 

If you test the extension with a backend user, who is no admin, it might happen that the editing menu does not appear on the frontend pages. 
If that is the case, it might help to include the following configuration in the TSconfig field of that backend user: 
admPanel {
  enable.edit = 1
  hide = 0
}
The line hide = 0 hides the admin panel. If you want to use it, you can also set this to hide = 1. This should not influence the frontend editing menu. 
Thanks for that hint to Mark Johnston and Walter Karlen! 

When you want to use feeditadvanced with workspaces a problem might be that stage changes and the like cannot be done without logging in to the backend. The reason is that the extension "version" is not being loaded in the frontend. As a temporary solution, you can open typo3conf/localconf.php and modify $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['EXT']['extList_FE'] to include the version extension.

Template issues
We tried to make the CSS of feeditadvanced bullet proof so that it works with as many page templates as possible. There is however a chance that it does not work with your page out of the box, but that you need to do some adjustments to get it working properly. 
When a backend user is logged in, feeditadvanced for example uses styles.content.get.stdWrap.prepend to put div containers into the columns of the frontend page. That way, the content elements can be highlighted and moved with the mouse. 
Note that these containers are only added to the most commonly used columns. If you want to work with feeditadvanced in other columns, you must add the needed definitions there, too. You find those definitions in the file ext_localconf.php of this extension. 
If you use the same properties in your custom template, they will override the ones of feeditadvanced, causing feeditadvanced to not work correctly. 
You can detect and fix that kind of problem in the TypoScript template tools. Just make sure that you do not use styles.content.get.stdWrap.prepend and its child properties. 



Use feeditadvanced with any kind of record
By default feeditadvanced is configured to be used with normal content elements coming from the database table tt_content. You can however use it with any database table, enabling you to also edit the records found in those tables with feeditadvanced. 
The following text was originally written by Dan Osipov. 
Here is some simple TypoScript code which you can put into the setup section of your TypoScript template. It allows you to edit tt_news records from the frontend: 
plugin.tt_news.displayList.title_stdWrap.editPanel = 1
plugin.tt_news.displayList.title_stdWrap.editPanel {
  editPanel = 1
  allow = edit,hide,delete
  line = 5
  label = %s
  onlyCurrentPid = 0
  previewBorder = 4
  edit.displayRecord = 1
}

Here is what you will see in the frontend, next to each tt_news title marker: 

And if you click edit, you will get the editing form from feeditadvanced allowing you to modify the record: 

Generally, any record which has stdWrap properties can be wrapped in this code to enable FE editing.
